# 🚀 AutoML System

## 📌 Overview
This cutting-edge **AutoML system** automates model selection, optimization, and deployment for **classification, regression, clustering, and reinforcement learning** tasks. It features **state-of-the-art preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, explainability, and enterprise-grade deployment capabilities**.

## ✨ Features
✅ **Automated Model Selection** – Chooses the best model based on accuracy, RMSE, or other evaluation criteria.  
✅ **Hyperparameter Optimization** – Uses **Optuna** for highly efficient tuning.  
✅ **Supervised Learning** – Supports **Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Naïve Bayes**, and more.  
✅ **Unsupervised Learning** – Implements **K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA**, and other clustering techniques.  
✅ **Reinforcement Learning** – Leverages **Stable-Baselines3 with Gym** for AI agent training.  
✅ **Data Preprocessing** – Handles **missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling**.  
✅ **Explainability & Feature Importance** – Utilizes **SHAP** and **Permutation Importance**.  
✅ **Automated Deployment** – Supports **Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud deployment**.  
✅ **Real-Time Monitoring** – Logs **model performance and data drift**.  

## 🛠 Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Usage
1️⃣ **Prepare Data** – Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.  
2️⃣ **Run AutoML** – Execute:
   ```bash
   python automl.py
   ```
3️⃣ **View Results** – Check the `reports/` folder for **feature importance, SHAP values, and predictions**.  
4️⃣ **Deploy Model** – The best model is saved in `models/best_model.pkl` for real-time inference.
