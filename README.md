# AutoML System

## Overview

This AutoML system is designed to automatically select, optimize, and deploy machine learning models for classification, regression, clustering, and reinforcement learning tasks. It includes advanced preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, explainability, and enterprise-grade deployment capabilities.

## Features

- **Automated Model Selection**: Chooses the best model based on accuracy, RMSE, or other criteria.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Uses Optuna for efficient tuning.
- **Supervised Learning**: Supports Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Naive Bayes, etc.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Includes K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA, and other clustering techniques.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Uses Stable-Baselines3 with Gym for AI agent training.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and scales features.
- **Feature Importance & Explainability**: Utilizes SHAP and Permutation Importance.
- **Automated Deployment**: Supports Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud deployment.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Logs model performance and data drift.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                # Main script for AutoML pipeline
â”œâ”€â”€ industry_data.csv  # Industry-level dataset
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Dependencies

```

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Data**: Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.
2. **Run AutoML**:
   ```bash
   python automl.py
   ```
3. **Results**: Check the `reports/` folder for feature importance, SHAP values, and predictions.
4. **Deploy Model**: The best model is saved in `models/best_model.pkl` and can be loaded for inference.

```

## Notes

- The system automatically detects if a task is classification or regression.
- If accuracy is below 98%, hyperparameter tuning is performed.
- Supports both pre-trained models and training from scratch based on feasibility.
