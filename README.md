# AutoML: Industry-Level Automated Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project automates the entire machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model selection, optimization, and deployment. It ensures high accuracy and industry-grade scalability for both classification and regression tasks.

## 🚀 Features
- Automatic data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Supports classification & regression tasks
- Handles imbalanced datasets using SMOTE
- Multiple ML models (RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, etc.)
- Hyperparameter optimization using Optuna
- Model explainability with SHAP
- Automated feature importance analysis
- Saves the best model & predictions for deployment
