# üìå Methodology: Universal AutoML System

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing

* **Missing Value Handling**: Numerical features are imputed using the median strategy to handle missing values.
* **Categorical Encoding**: Categorical variables are automatically encoded into numerical format using Label Encoding.
* **Outlier Removal**: Applies Interquartile Range (IQR) method to detect and remove outliers for cleaner data.
* **Feature Scaling**: Features are scaled using `RobustScaler` to handle outliers and ensure robust scaling.
* **Imbalance Correction**: For classification tasks, applies **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to balance minority classes and prevent model bias.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Task Detection

* Automatically identifies the problem type as:

  * **Classification**: If target variable contains discrete categories.
  * **Regression**: If target variable contains continuous values.
  * **Unsupervised (Clustering)**: If no target variable is provided.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training and Selection

* The system trains multiple models based on task type:

### Supervised Learning Models

* RandomForest
* XGBoost
* LightGBM
* CatBoost
* Deep Neural Network (DNN)

### Unsupervised Learning Models

* K-Means

* DBSCAN

* Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

* Agglomerative Clustering

* Models are evaluated using:

  * **Accuracy Score** for classification
  * **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for regression
  * **Silhouette Score** for clustering

* The best-performing model is automatically selected based on these evaluation metrics.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperparameter Optimization

* All supervised models undergo automated hyperparameter tuning using **Optuna**.
* Searches optimal parameters to maximize model performance for each algorithm.
* Provides efficient, scalable search without manual intervention.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Explainability

* Implements model interpretability via:

  * **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)** for detailed feature importance analysis.
  * **Permutation Importance** for ranking feature relevance.
* Generates interpretable visualizations saved in the reports directory.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Saving & Deployment

* The final best model is saved automatically in the `models/` directory.
* Fully ready for deployment in production pipelines.
* Supports integration with cloud platforms, Docker, or Kubernetes.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Reporting & Monitoring

* Generates detailed reports in `reports/` directory including:

  * Model predictions
  * Feature importance plots
  * Evaluation summaries
* Logs model performance metrics and training insights for monitoring.
